Shell Scripts
=============

These are my shell scripts and what they do for me:

* conkeror &mdash; Fires up the Conkeror web browser
* otf2ttf &mdash; Converts OTF files to TTF files (work in progress)
* tmx &mdash; Starts or connects to a tmux session
* topsum &mdash; Wrapper for top that gives cumulative memory usage to multi-process applications
